 Easy Apache is a simple script that helps in installing Apache server and SSL certificates for Apache sites.
 It'll ask you for a few questions like domain name if you want to install
 SSL (Yes or No questions) etc other than that it does most of the things
 like configuring apache, setting up virtual host, managing different
 directories for each site, enabling site, disabling default sites
 applying SSL certificate to the domain only you specify.
