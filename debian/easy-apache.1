DESCRIPTION
        Easy Apache is a simple script that helps you setup an Apache server, configure it completely, 
        and it also helps you in installing SSL certificates for all your Apache sites.
        It'll ask for a few inputs, like domain name, do you want to install SSL, etc that's it.

        It takes care of configuring Apache, setting up virtual hosts (vhosts), managing different directories for each site, 
        enabling site, disabling sites, and even installing an SSL certificate to your Apache sites.

        If you have any questions/issues, please let me know on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/realpvn/easy-apache/)
